The mod comes with usual Mod Menu integration.

An additional extra for nerds, who prefer typing raw formatting codes, is the option to enable the insertion of the formatting character 'ยง' by pressing Ctrl+[. 


## Requires (Fabric)

- [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)
- Optional, but recommended [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)

## Related projects

- [Text Utilities](https://modrinth.com/mod/text-utilities) adds color and formatting options to signs, book and anvils, but unfortunately it has not been updated to Minecraft 1.21.5 version at the time of writing, and it is a Fabric only mod.  
- [Iron Signs](https://modrinth.com/mod/ironsigns) adds vibrant, high contrast, painted signs, which can be colored and formatted similarily. It also enables coloring and formatting Vanilla wooden signs exactly the same way as this mod. I wonder who wrote that mod.
